# OpenFF multi-Br ESP Fragment Conformers v1.1

## Description

A dataset containing molecules from the [OpenFF ESP Fragment Conformers v1.0](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/blob/master/submissions/2022-01-16-OpenFF-ESP-Fragment-Conformers-v1.0) dataset with modifications.
Molecules with multiple Cl atoms were selected from the dataset and the Cl atoms were replaced with Br.

For each molecule, a set of up to 5 conformers were generated by:
  * generating a set of up to 1000 conformers with a RMS cutoff of 0.5 Å using the OpenEye backend of the OpenFF toolkit
  * applying ELF conformer selection (max 5 conformers) using OpenEye

Each conformer will be converged according to the 'GAU_LOOSE' criteria.
We only save the results (gradient, wavefunction, etc.) for the final conformation in each optimization trajectory to reduce storage requirements.

### Change log
* v1.0 Initial submission
* v1.1 Create basic set from optimized conformers [OpenFF multi-Br ESP Fragment Conformers v1.0](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission/tree/master/submissions/2023-11-02-OpenFF-multi-Br-ESP-Fragment-Conformers-v1.0), pruning any whose connectivity changed after optimisation or where the RMSD of optimised conformers was closer than 0.05 Å
