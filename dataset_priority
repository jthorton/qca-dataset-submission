This file contains a relative ranking of dataset priority. 

While queueing is still handled manually, *this* is the single place where priority is determined. 

New datasets that are added should be included in this list if they are to be submitted. 

Do not modify this directly in master -- Always open a PR and get at least one approving review before merging.
